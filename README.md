# TCG Pocket Collection Tracker

TCG Pocket Collection Tracker is an application designed to help users efficiently track their Pokémon Pocket game cards, identify optimal card packs to open, manage trades, and engage with both friends and the community at large. Our application is completely free, open-source, and prioritizes user privacy by not selling data, tracking analytics or using advertisements.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
The frontend is built as a static HTML site, powered by React and TypeScript. We utilize Vite to compile it into a standalone application, which is hosted cost-free on GitHub Pages. The UI leverages ShadCN and Tailwind CSS, while react-table is employed for handling extensive card lists, supported by react-virtualize for efficient data virtualization.

### Backend
Our backend infrastructure utilizes Supabase. The backend manages user authentication (via OTP email) and includes a database for card storage.
